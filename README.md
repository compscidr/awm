# awm-lib: Android Wireless Measurement Library
![Android Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/compscidr/awm-lib.svg?branch=master)

This project aims to collect and open source wireless statistics and information in a way that does not disrupt the functioning of apps, but provides useful data such as:

* what percentage of the day a user has internet access?
* how long does the user use Wi-Fi versus Cellular data?
* how often and for how long are users within Bluetooth range of each other?
* how often and for how long are users within Wi-Fi or Wi-Fi direct range of each other?
* how often and for how long are users within NFC range of each other?
* periodically sample their network performance: throughput, delay, jitter, etc.

## Using the library
Add to your `build.gradle` file the following:
```
dependencies {
  implementation 'io.rightmesh:awm:1.0.4'
}
```
This has been tested with gradle 4.9 and Android Studio 3.2.


Simply construct an `AndroidWirelessStatsCollector` and call the `start()` function. You can do this in the `onCreate` call if you like.

```
awsc = new AndroidWirelessStatsCollector(this);
awsc.start();
```

Then to clean up, in the onDestroy just call the `stop()` function.
```
awsc.stop();
```

## Receiving the stats that are being collected
The library is setup to publish RxJava events to the applications so they can receive the stats as they are being collected.
Currently, there are only Bluetooth and GPS stats being collected.

In order to receive the EventBus events you need to initailise the event bus:
```
protected Bus eventBus = BusProvider.getInstance();
```

and register to receive the events:
```
eventBus.register(this);
```

To obtain Bluetooth stats:
```
@Subscribe public void updateBTDevices(BluetoothStats btStats) {
  ...
}
```

And to obtain GPS stats:
```
@Subscribe public void updateGPS(GPSStats gpsStats) {
  ...
}
```

You can see an example of this data being displayed in an activity in the example project:
