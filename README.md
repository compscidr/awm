Android Wireless Measurement Library

This project aims to collect and open source wireless statistics and information in a way that does not disrupt the functioning of apps, but provides useful data such as:

* what percentage of the day a user has internet access?
* how long does the user use Wi-Fi versus Cellular data?
* how often and for how long are users within Bluetooth range of each other?
* how often and for how long are users within Wi-Fi or Wi-Fi direct range of each other?
* how often and for how long are users within NFC range of each other?
* periodically sample their network performance: throughput, delay, jitter, etc.
